Hey there! Welcome to my website. Here's a little bit about me.

I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Texas, Austin. I am advised by Prof. Isil Dillig. I am part of the amazing UToPiA lab. My research interests are in programming languages and compilers.

Previously, I spent two amazing years at Microsoft Research, India as a Research Fellow. I worked with Rahul Sharma in the EdgeML team.
